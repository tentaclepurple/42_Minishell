- [ ] Compile

      - USE make -n to see if compilation use -Wall -Wextra -Werror if not use invalid compilation flags
      - minishell Compile without errors if not use flags
      - makefile must not re-link
      
- [ ] Simple Command & global

      - Execute a simple command with an absolute path like /bin/ls or any other command without options
      - How many global variables? why? Give a concrete example of why it feels mandatory or logical.
      - Test an empty command.
      - Test only spaces or tabs.
      - if something crashes use the crash flag.
      - if something is not working use the incomplete work flag.

- [ ] Arguments & history

        - Execute a simple command with an absolute path like /bin/ls or any other command with arguments but without
          quotes and double quotes
        - Repeat multiple times with different commands and arguments
        - if something crashes use the crash flag.
        - if something is not working use the incomplete work flag.

      
- [ ] echo

        - Execute the echo command with or without arguments or -n
        - Repeat multiple times with different arguments
        - if something crashes use the crash flag.

        - if something is not working use the incomplete work flag
      
- [ ] Return value of a process

        - Execute a simple command with an absolute path like /bin/ls or any other command with arguments but without
        quotes and double quotes then execute echo $?
        - Check the printed value. You can repeat the same in bash and compare it.
        - Repeat multiple times with different commands and arguments, use some failing commands like '/bin/ls
        filethatdoesntexist'
        - anything like expr $? + $?
        - if something crashes use the crash flag.
        - if something is not working use the incomplete work flag.
